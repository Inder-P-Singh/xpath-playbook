# XPath examples and expected element text (sample.html)

1) Absolute-style brittle example (may break if DOM changes)
XPath: //html/body/div[2]/div[1]/form/input[2]
Expected: (often nothing in this sample — demonstrates brittleness)

2) Robust: anchor by label + axis
XPath: //label[normalize-space()='Username']/following-sibling::input[1]
Expected element value / text: input element with id="user_123" (value="alice")

3) Robust: normalize-space to handle messy whitespace
XPath: //button[normalize-space()='Submit']
Expected element text: "Submit"

4) Dynamic-id partial match (starts-with)
XPath: //input[starts-with(@id,'user_')]
Expected: matches input id="user_123"

5) Combined conditions (precise targeting)
XPath: //a[@role='button' and contains(@href,'/checkout') and normalize-space()='Buy now']
Expected element text: "Buy now"

6) Ancestor axis example (navigating up)
XPath: //div[contains(@class,'card')]/ancestor::section[1]
Expected: selects the containing <section id="demo-section">

Notes:
- Use $x("...") in Chrome DevTools Console to evaluate these XPaths quickly.
- The demo HTML contains deliberate wrapper div to illustrate the difference between brittle absolute paths and robust relative/anchor locators.
